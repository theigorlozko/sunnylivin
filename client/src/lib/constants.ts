/**
 * ------------------------------
 * üåø CONSTANTS FILE ‚Äì Purpose & Structure
 * ------------------------------
 * This file defines shared enums, icons, and reference values 
 * used across the application for consistency in form inputs, filtering, 
 * and visual rendering (e.g. icons on cards or maps).
 *
 * üìå Why this exists:
 * - Centralizes all enums (like product categories, shop types)
 * - Ensures consistent labels across forms, filters, and UI
 * - Prevents typos or mismatches in category names
 * - Associates each type with the correct icon component
 *
 * üß© Main Sections:
 * 1. ‚úÖ HighlightEnum & HighlightIcons ‚Äì Unique selling points of the *shop*
 * 2. ‚úÖ ProductCategoryEnum ‚Äì Main food groups (Milk, Cheese, etc.)
 * 3. ‚úÖ ProductSubcategories ‚Äì Sub-selection options per category (e.g. Goat, Cow)
 * 4. ‚úÖ ProductTags ‚Äì Optional labels for filtering (e.g. Raw, Organic)
 * 5. ‚úÖ VendorShopType & Icons ‚Äì Type of shop (Bakery, Farm, Van, etc.)
 * 6. ‚úÖ NAVBAR_HEIGHT ‚Äì Shared layout constant
 *
 * üîÑ Usage:
 * - Used in frontend form dropdowns, filters, map rendering
 * - Makes the app easier to scale and maintain
